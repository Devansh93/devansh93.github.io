# Welcome to My Github Page

As I advance in my learnings about data science, I also publish the projects that give me a chance to practically implement all of my knowledge. I recently got the chance to finish a couple of data science projects thanks to the learnings that I have obtained from EDHEC and Coursera IBM Data Science Specialization.

### Project 1: Executing SQL Queries on 3 Chicago city Datasets uploaded on IBM DB2 Cloud Database  (Completion Date: March 3,2019) <br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/fed65c26fd5eea170a853a79f989f38b"> SQL Project </a> (<-- Link) At the end of Course 5 <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science"> Databases and SQL for Datascience </a> of IBM Data Science Specialization , I was able to practically implement my knowledge of SQL Queries and SQL Databases on real world dataset of Chicago city by doing this project.

### Project 2: Determining the best resale value for a car (Completion Date: March 23,2019) <br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/07b6979b71cb92952e6ea106119f24d2"> First Phase </a> (<-- Link) Imported an open dataset from a website and performed several data wrangling/data cleansing operations to come up with a cleaned dataset. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/f7724507f590cfae1e7f3a6c14067aab"> Second Phase </a> (<-- Link) Performed Exploratory data Analysis on several features and determined strong predicting features based upon which the resale value of car price can be predicted. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/734efa2e52dcf2e6978dae3c4e84f5b6"> Third Phase </a> (<-- Link) After determining important predictor features in the previous phase of this project, I created different models that can be used to predict the resale value of a car. These Models were created Either by using 1 predictor variable or by using Multiple Predictor Variables. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/6cfd964b386058e69b5d49e94f65b164"> Fourth Phase </a> (<-- Link) In this final Phase, I evaluated the prediction models built in the last phase by performing analysis operations on training sets and testing sets. I further tried to improve the accuracy of prediction models using cross validation, Ridge Regression, and GridsearchCV <br/><br/>
