# Welcome to My Github Page

As I advance in my learnings about data science, I also publish the projects that give me a chance to practically implement all of my knowledge. I recently got the chance to finish a couple of data science projects thanks to the learnings that I have obtained from EDHEC and Coursera IBM Data Science Specialization.

### Project 1: Executing SQL Queries on 3 Chicago city Datasets by uploading them on IBM DB2 Cloud Database  (Completion Date: March 3,2019) <br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/b1a9b4906178ae80ae40a0db0cd448cd"> SQL Project </a> (<-- Link) At the end of Course 5 <a href = "https://www.coursera.org/learn/sql-data-science"> Databases and SQL for Datascience </a> of IBM Data Science Specialization , I was able to practically implement my knowledge of SQL Queries and SQL Databases on real world dataset of Chicago city by doing this project.

### Project 2: Determining the best resale value for a car (Completion Date: March 23,2019) <br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/07b6979b71cb92952e6ea106119f24d2"> First Phase </a> (<-- Link) Imported an open dataset from a website and performed several data wrangling/data cleansing operations to come up with a cleaned dataset. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/f7724507f590cfae1e7f3a6c14067aab"> Second Phase </a> (<-- Link) Performed Exploratory data Analysis on several features and determined strong predicting features based upon which the resale value of car price can be predicted. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/734efa2e52dcf2e6978dae3c4e84f5b6"> Third Phase </a> (<-- Link) After determining important predictor features in the previous phase of this project, I created different models that can be used to predict the resale value of a car. These Models were created Either by using 1 predictor variable or by using Multiple Predictor Variables. <br/><br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/6cfd964b386058e69b5d49e94f65b164"> Fourth Phase </a> (<-- Link) In this final Phase, I evaluated the prediction models built in the last phase by performing analysis operations on training sets and testing sets. I further tried to improve the accuracy of prediction models using cross validation, Ridge Regression, and GridsearchCV <br/><br/>

### Project 3:Data visualization about Immigration from different countries to Canada (Completion Date: April 14,2019) <br/>
<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/fc959b6a20a198f8864d437e3cab787e"> First Part </a> (<-- Link) Imported an open dataset extracted from Official United Nations website. Performed basic data cleansing operations and created a plethora of visualizations to analyse Immigration trends from different countries to Canada. Different types of Graphs include:
1. Line Plots
2. Area Plots
3. Histograms
4. Bar Charts
5. Pie Charts
6. Box and Subplots, and Scatter Plots.
7. Bubble Plots.

<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/19ad6bf3de1038270617b5eaddb5f0fa"> Second Part </a> (<-- Link) Created Waffle Charts to perform immigration analyses from Scandinavian countries to Canada. I also created a word cloud from the Canada Immigration report 2014 and then, displayed the final word cloud in the shape of Canada's Map.

<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/b3b4f14fb4fafe66dcf5383e04dc8aac"> Third Part </a> (<-- Link) By using the crime dataset available at SanFrancisco city page, I displayed the different types of crimes happening at different locations in Sanfrancisco for the year 2016.

Used the dataset for Canada Immigration to create a choropleth map which showed Immigration to Canada from different countries across the world. Imported the cleaned dataset from Part 1 of this project and modified it a little to use it for ploting Choropleth Maps.

The maps were not being displayed in the github gist. Therefore please find below the screenshot of the maps which were created in part 3:
