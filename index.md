## Welcome to My Github Page

Here you can take a look at all of my Data science projects performed by me. I recently got the chance to finish my first data science project thanks to the learning that I have obtained from EDHEC and Coursera Data Science Specialization.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/Devansh93/devansh93.github.io/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.<br/>
Project 1: Determining the best resale value for a car <br/>
[First Phase]<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/4a1b50c81596d60dc0e8435eee4ddbd7"> First Phase</a> Imported an open dataset from a website and performed several data wrangling/data cleansing operations to come up with a cleaned dataset. <br/>
[Second Phase]<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/f7724507f590cfae1e7f3a6c14067aab"> Second Phase</a> Performed Exploratory data Analysis on several features and determined strong predicting features based upon which the resale value of car price can be predicted. <br/>
[Third Phase]<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/734efa2e52dcf2e6978dae3c4e84f5b6"> Third Phase</a> After determining important predictor features in the previous phase of this project, I created different models that can be used to predict the resale value of a car. These Models were created Either by using 1 predictor variable or by using Multiple Predictor Variables. <br/>
[Fourth Phase]<a href = "https://gist.github.com/Devansh93/02027d81291a256baeffe8afa6555f6a"> Fourth Phase</a> In this final Phase, I evaluated the prediction models built in the last phase by performing anaysis operations on training sets and testing sets. I further tried to improve the accuracy of prediction models using cross validation, Ridge Regression, and GridsearchCV <br/>
### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Devansh93/devansh93.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
